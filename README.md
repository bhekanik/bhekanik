Hi, I'm BK. I'm a Software Engineer at [Contentful](https://contentful.com/). Most recently I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Anaplan](https://anaplan.com), and [Sigma Digital](https://www.sigmadigital.io/) before that. I've also worked as a GIS Developer at [ESRI South Africa](https://www.esri-southafrica.com/) and [RAMM Technologies](https://www.ramm.co.za/). I write about interesting things I learn on the [Just Reflections newsletter](https://justreflections.bhekani.com/) and recently I started blogging about tech on [my blog](https://blog.bhekani.com).
