# Hi, I'm BK

My full name is Bhekani Khumalo but most people call me BK. 

When others know things about us, we work better together and save a lot of time and energy. Usually, people only come to know these titbits after working together for a while – and it takes a lot of trial and error.

I'm writing this in the hope that we can fast forward through some getting-to-know-you facets of me that we might miss.

**Important:** NOT meant as a replacement for actually getting to know each other.

I am really keen to do great work with/for you and I can be extremely, extraordinarily creative and productive under the right conditions.

I am also very imperfect and I hope that my transparency here is not treated as an excuse for my flaws but as a guide for you to know how I might fail. Consider this an open invite for you to call me out and prevent bigger pain down the road.

The creation of this has also helped me to identify and refine my thoughts and values.

This is a living breathing thing and likely incomplete. I update it frequently and would appreciate your feedback.

## My Role

My professional background is as a Civil And Water Engineer. I worked for my local Municipality as a water engineer for the first four years of my career. I was also previously a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) Developer at RAMM Technologies and ESRI South Africa, Senior Software Developer at Sigma Digital and Software Engineer at Anaplan. My current role is Senior Software Engineer at Contentful.

## Me in a few words

- I was born and raised in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Some of my family is still there but my parents live in Malawi now.
- I lived in South Africa for four years when I moved from Zimbabwe and after that I moved to the UK where I live now.
- My educational and professional background is in Civil and Water Engineering. I worked as a civil engineer for 5 years before transitioning to GIS and eventually software engineering.
- I had been accepted for a PhD in Environmental and Chemical Engineering just before I left civil engineering. My research was on finding efficient ways to extract useful by products from wastewater. (Ask me about this if you aren't sure how to start a conversation with me)
- All my GIS and Software engineering is self taught or more appropriately I should say [community taught](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxgDfOHHadU). Mostly through free resources online.
- I enjoy writing and speaking in public. I've spoken several times in the Johannesburg and London tech meetup scene and at DevConf 2020 and I'm working on being more active in tech spaces online.

## Personality Quirks

- I am an introvert and that means highly stimulating environments can be exhausting for me. However, I still love meeting new people and making new friends (in low stimulation environments). Meetings with three of us are perfect, three to eight are ok, and more than eight you will find that I am strangely quiet. Do not confuse my quietness with lack of engagement. (I really like talking about introversion and my personal experinces because of it so if you get me started on this I may go on and on.)
- I love to start new things but I often lose interest when I can mentally see how the thing is going to finish which might be weeks or months before the thing is actually done. I’m working on getting better at this.

## Known Failure Modes

- I have a tendency to want to be right: In discussions, I can keep pushing a point because I think it’s right, not because it objectively is. Please call me out on it if you feel this is happening and I will address it.
- I have had problems in the past with not doing a good job sharing knowledge: I would take certain pieces of complex work because it was easier for me to just do it. This disempowers the team. This prevents people less familiar with the thing from having the opportunity to grow.
- I care about my words and endeavour to choose them carefully. I take this too far sometimes, overthinking my words or being overly pedantic.
- I almost always default to avoiding confrontation. I spend way too much time trying to figure out how to deal with things without direct confrontation. This can waste a lot of time and it's not always possible and confrontation is necessary sometimes (or so I've been told). I'm working on this.
- People have commented that I like working on too many things at once
- I shut down when people are bike shedding (spending disproportionate time debating small things that they know well while not discussing bigger things that really matter). Yes, what "really matters" is subjective. But I will pick silence over contributing to what I perceive as noise (probably related to my introversion). If it really does matter and you see me shut off, please tell me why it matters (see 5 Whys). I may respond by pointing to the bigger thing that does matter in my view.
- This is a non-exhaustive list; there are definitely more things I can't think of right now.

## How I work

- Preferred communication method
  - The best way to communicate with me is via the preferred instant messaging platform our organization uses. I'm pretty good with a lot of context switches so I generally read all instant messages instantly (if I saw the notification) but I don't always respond to them instantly - particularly when I am in the middle of something else. However, this assures you that I have seen/will see your message as soon as possible and will either respond immediately or start thinking about it. If it feels like we’re having trouble communicating, I will always err on the side of, “let’s hop on a video call and hash this out”
  - I read and respond to email much slower than instant messages. I usually read emails in the morning between the start of the day and around 11am so if you send an email after that, I will likely respond later or the next day if the subject doesn't signal to me that it's urgent.
  - I generally don't prefer calls unless they have been scheduled or they can't be avoided. This is because calls require me to immediately stop what I am doing and attend to them and fully commit right now, and they don't keep an easy to scan record of the discussion (it's probably also linked to my introversion). If we are getting on a call, I prefer video calls because I like to read body language.
  - I like “closing the loop.” For example, if someone emails both of us and you take care of the issue without CC/BCC'ing me or just pinging me to let me know, I will worry about it and it will sit in my inbox. Even a quick “I’ve got this” will free up my brain and I will thank you.
- Working hours
  - I'm a night owl, this means I feel more focused and energetic in at night and I do my best work at night, preferably after midnight.
  - I may send messages or emails outside of working hours, no one should feel obligated to read or respond to these immediately, I just send them during my working hours and I have no expectation for people to be working outside of their working hours. Similarly, if I receive a message outside of regular working hours, I may not respond quickly. I do try to keep up with notifications in case there's anything urgent, but if I read a message and it's non-urgent, I may leave it until I'm back at work.
  - While I will work during the day if I need to (in most cases I need to to overlap with the working hours of the team) I generally prefer not to do highly demanding work before 11am. So I usually take this time to do less demanding work like going through email. While doing this, I'll be sorting it and building up my to-do list for later when I get into the zone. But I make sure I'm always reachable and available to the team and for all the meetings and tasks that need me. 

## **Feedback**

- If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that doesn't fit in any of these categories. Even if you think it might not be the case, I *do* want to hear it. And if you think I don't want to hear it, I'd love to hear why you feel that way.
- If you can give me this feedback via my preferred communication method, that's great. If you're only comfortable with something else, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all.
- If you're not comfortable giving me some feedback yourself, I'd love for you to give it to someone above me in the management chain so they can anonymously relay it to me.

## My Interests

Here are some things I love. If you ever want to strike up casual conversation and don't know what to talk about, these are good bets.

- I love fantasy and science fiction literature and I recently fell in love with Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere books, I've read all that are currently out right now and I'm eagerly waiting for the next ones.
- I love superhero movies and TV shows in general and Marvel ones in particular. I have again seen all the movies and watched many of the reviews on YouTube, I'm always happy to engage in a conversation.
- I'm currently really interested in AI and machine learning (like many people). Teaching myself Natural Language Processing (NLP) on the side. 
- I am a pretty good artist (drawing and painting) and I'd probably be much better if I practiced more, I believe that this is the creating pursuit that I am most gifted in. I love music - listening, singing, playing instruments - I always wish I could give more time to practising instruments but it's always superseded by other things. I am currently learning French.
- I'm a big tech enthusiast and I love to keep up with tech news. Prod me on this and I'll definitely have something to say.
- I recently took an interest in investing in the stock market and in crypto currencies. I am still learning which means I have a lot to say and even more to ask.
